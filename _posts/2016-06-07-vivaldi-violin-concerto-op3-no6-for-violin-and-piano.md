## Vivaldi Violin Concerto Op.3 No.6 for Violin and Piano

The 12 concerti that make up L'estro Armonico were composed in 1711\. The A minor violin concerto Op. 3 No.6 is possibly the first Vivaldi concerto that violinist learn, I know it was mine!

As a teacher, I use this concerto with just about all my pupils at some point. It makes a good piece to play for a concert, audition or festival. One of the problems with this though is not the violin part but the piano part. If the pianist has to sight-read the piano part, (especially the Suzuki version) it can be tricky in places. I've been meaning to do a simplified piano part for years and after a near mishap recently I decided t was about time.

I've tried to keep the left hand as close to the cello line as possible and make an easier, stripped down right had.

Let me know what you think!
